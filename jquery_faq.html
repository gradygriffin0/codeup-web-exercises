        <h3>Yellowstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellowstone is the worldâ€™s first national park.</li>
            <li>3,472 square miles (8,991 km2)</li>
            <li>More than 10,000 hydrothermal features</li>

        <h3>Yosemite</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yosemite National Park covers nearly 1,200 square miles.</li>
            <li>The American Indians who live in Yosemite are called the Ahwahneechee Indians. Their traditional homes
                look like teepees, but are actually made of incense-cedar bark.
            </li>
            <li>California has approximately 7,000 known plant species. Yosemite contains twenty percent of those

            <li>Death Valley National Park covers a total area of 3,367,627 acres</li>
            <li>The name Death Valley came from a group of pioneers lost in the area in 1849. Although only one of the
                group died, they all thought they would, and dubbed the area Death Valley as they finally exited.
            </li>
            <li>Death Valley is the largest national park in the United States outside of Alaska, taking over the title
                from Yellowstone National Park upon its creation in 1994.
